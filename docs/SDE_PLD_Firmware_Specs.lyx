\begin_layout Abstract
This document describes the high level specifications for the PLD firmware
 for the SDE Upgrade Electronics.
 In particular, it describes the interface between the custom firmware and
 the embedded ARM processor as well as the necessary interconnections between
 the various subsections.
 This document is a work in progress.
 The most current version is kept in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk/docs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beyond2015_sde_pld
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 SVN repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Modules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of the PLD firmware is split into several logically distinct,
 loosely connected, modules to define a high level structure and enable
 partitioning of the development effort among various institutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major high level modules are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Trigger (including event buffers)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Time tagging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
LED controller
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Digital interface to external detectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Xilinx Vivado development tools are used.
 The highest level which includes the various interfaces the processor via
 the AXI bus is built using the Vivado block diagram tools.
 Lower levels of custom firmware are coded directly in Verilog.
 This structure allows the relatively clean mating to the SVN repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For storage in SVN a directory structure recommended by Xilinx is used.
 The shell script 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, located in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory scan through a project directory and tag those files that need
 to be stored in SVN.
 Some hand addition or removal of files from SVN may be required.
 This helps to avoid temporary files created by Vivado from being stored
 in SVN.
 Please look at the source code for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tag_for_svn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to more information about the directory structure it expects.
 For custom IP in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ip_repo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory, the entire tree of the IP should be added to SVN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each WP with firmware has its own master directory in the SVN repository.
 For example, front end development work is in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk/wp1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the trigger code development work is in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk/wp2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and time tagging is in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk/wp3
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Archives of snapshots of the integrated Vivado projects are kept in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trunk/wp5/sde_pl_hhddmmyy.tar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where hhddmmyy corresponds to the ID of the trigger module.
 In addition to the Vivado project archive, a copy of this file, the sde_trigger
 header files, and some example programs are included in the tar file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Interconnections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modules to Processor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous incarnations of the SDE electronics for Auger and Auger North
 the processor and the PLD firmware were on separate chips.
 This meant that the PLD interfaced to the processor bus.
 In fact the PLD looked just like an external static RAM to the processor.
 This meant that the PLD needed to decode addresses, control signals and
 strobes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not necessary anymore with the Zynq chip and the Vivado tools.
 The Xilinx provided bus interface IP can take care of all of those details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The control register interfaces are implemented via a Vivado AXI register
 peripheral IP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CPU interrupt signals, if required, are implemented via the same IP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Event storage (& associated information) is implemented as double buffered
 dual ported memory.
 This will be discussed further in a later section.

\end_inset

Trigger and Time Tagging Interconnection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original Auger (South) design, the trigger and time-tagging circuits
 are on separate chips.
 A somewhat elaborate scheme of bus signals was devised to ensure that the
 correct time-tag was associated with the correct event.
 This is simplified in the new design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to correctly associate the event time with the event data, the
 trigger module send a signal to the time tagging circuit telling it to
 latch the current time.
 In both previous designs this is simply the number of clock ticks since
 the last GPS 1PPS signal.
 But this is not sufficient.
 The trigger circuit must also tell the time tagging which of the event
 buffers the time should be associated with.
 This implies the time tagging and the trigger need to use the same number
 of buffers.
 We have chosen to use 4 buffers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original Auger South design we also encode the trigger signal to
 be able to measure the dead-time of the circuit.
 That is, the trigger time (actually the end of trace time) is indicated
 when an active-low signal (called /EVTCLKF in the currently operating design)
 is asserted.
 If another buffer is available at that time, the signal returns to its
 non-active high state after 100 ns.
 However, if there is no buffer available, the signal remains low until
 a buffer becomes available.
 The time-tagging circuit records both edges.
 In the upgrade dead-time will be indicated by an active high signal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DEAD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the trigger to the time-tagging modules.
 The time-tagging module will keep track of the dead-time fraction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that in addition to the shower event data, single
 muons also recorded for calibration.
 When a muon calibration buffer becomes full (containing many muons) a muon
 trigger interrupt is asserted.
 This requires each of the signals described above to be duplicated for
 that trigger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If additional specialized calibration triggers are developed that require
 their own buffers, then additional copies of the interconnection signals
 would follow.
 (For example, we don't know how to implement an efficient muon decay trigger
 at present.
 It is possible this may require something beyond the normal muon buffers.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trigger circuit will present to the processor the information detailing
 which buffer should be read for each event.
 As long at the processor reads the same buffer from each interface the
 time tags will remain synchronized with the events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A corollary to this scheme is that all of the circuits that provide portions
 of the event data utilize the same 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

done
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signal from the CPU to free up the buffer for a new event.
 All must use the same trigger signal to close one buffer and move to the
 next, and that signal should not be set by the processor until the data
 for an event has been read from all of the interfaces.
 Presumably the full event readout is done in a single interrupt service
 routine, so this restriction is not difficult to adhere to.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Trigger and LED interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trigger circuit needs to be informed when the trigger is initiated by
 a LED pulse.
 Operationally we wish to be able to initiate a LED pulse of a given amplitude
 at a given time.
 The trigger circuit does not need to know anything about the requested
 amplitude, but it does need to know that there was a LED flash so that
 it can add a flag to the trigger bits for the event.
 This is implemented in the sde_trigger module, based upon the VHDL code
 provided by Roberto Assiro.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Trigger and Digital Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trigger circuit needs to send a trigger signal to the digital interface
 circuit.
 Note that this is not the same signal as that sent to the time tagging
 circuit.
 The signal to the digital interface should presumably be prompt, while
 that to the time tagging is tied to a fixed bin location within the tank
 PMT trace.
 Details are to be defined if/when interfaced detector is specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interface summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is a placeholder for a summary of the interface signals.
 At the moment only those between the trigger and time-tagging modules are
 defined.
 They are described in section

Register Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The register address space of the trigger circuitry occupies 256 control
 registers and 5 interrupt control registers.
 Compatibility with the previous register structure has been maintained
 where practical.
 Where this is the case the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Compatibility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will appear in the title, and the register addresses and bit structure
 will be the same as in the pre-upgrade electronics.
 Not (yet) implemented features are indicated by cyan text.
 The symbolic names and addresses of all the registers are defined in the
 file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sde_trigger_defs.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which should be included in any C program that references the registers.
 (sde_trigger_defs.h is located in the ip_repo/sde_trigger tree.) In addition
 to register names and addresses, various bit masks and shifts associated
 with the registers are defined in this header file.
 Some of the symbolic names and addresses are shown in the included tables.
 Additional ones can be found in sde_trigger_defs.h.
 Many of the tables in the following sections include a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Width
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 field.
 While all reads and writes transfer a 32 bit word, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Width
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 field, if provided, indicates the highest bit of the word read or written
 that useful.
 Higher order bits than that return 0 on read, and are ignored on write.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compatibility mode triggers operate on a signal that has been filtered
 using a FIR Nyquist filter with a 20 MHz cutoff to approximate the frequency
 response of the previous electronics.
 These triggers sample every 3rd bin of the filtered signal.
 The filtered signals are saved in the shower buffers, in otherwise unused
 bits, to allow access for debugging purposes.
 They may be stripped out before sending the data from the local station
 to the campus.
 However, the filtered waveform (except for the sampling phase) can be generated
 by applying a finite impulse response filter to the full bandwidth waveform,
 as indicated in the code snippet below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
int fir[21] = {5,0,12,22,0,-61,-96,0,256,551,681,551,256,0,-96,-61,0,22,12,0,5};

Compatibility single bin trigger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Compatibility single bin triggers operate on a single ADC time bin, after
 down-sampling from 120 to 40 MHz.
 This trigger is controlled by the registers shown below.
 The new ADCs have 2 more bits, added at the low end, so the thresholds
 (above baseline) must be approximately 4 times larger (in ADC counts) than
 with the previous electronics to replicate the behavior of the original
 electronics.
 Note that the signal must be strictly greater than the specified threshold
 for the trigger to fire.
 The multiplicity must be greater than or equal to the specified multiplicity.

 If the occupancy exceeds a specified value, a time-over-threshold shower
 trigger is generated.

Time-over-threshold trigger (deconvoluted)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color cyan
The time-over-threshold-deconvoluted trigger first deconvolutes the typical
 exponential fall from the FADC trace, secondly applies a pulse height window
 to each deconvoluted trace, and thirdly counts the number of bins within
 a sliding window which meet pulse height window conditions.
 Finally, if the occupancy exceeds a specified value in the required multiplicit
y of deconvoluted traces, a time-over-threshold-deconvoluted shower trigger
 is generated.
 Please note that the order of operations is not the same as for the time-over-t
hreshold trigger above.

Note that the THRx and OCC conditions are satisfied when the signal is strictly
 greater than (
\begin_inset Formula $>$

) the register value, while UPx condition is satisfied when the signal is
 less than or equal to (

 Thus writing 1023 to an UPx register disables that constraint.

Multiplicity of Positive Steps 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\color cyan
The multiplicity-of-positive-steps (MOPS) trigger counts positive steps
 in each FADC trace, accumulating bin to bin steps until the first bin which
 is smaller than the previous bin is encountered.
 The aggregate positive step is then subjected to a minimum & maximum height
 constraint.
 If it passes this condition the step is added to the count of such steps
 within a fixed length 120 bin long sliding window.
 A variable length veto may be applied to ignore aggregate steps following
 another such step.
 Finally, if the occupancy exceeds a specified value in the required multiplicit
y of traces, and the integrated signal exceeds a specified value in those
 same traces, a multiplicity-of-positive-steps trigger is formed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color cyan
The signal integration operates by keeping a running sum of the pulse height
 in the current ADC time bin minus that in the bin 250 time slots earlier.
 However, there is a period after a trigger, when no triggers are possible
 due to finishing the ADC trace or if no buffers are available, in which
 the earlier time bin is not available in the PLD.
 While this does not affect any triggered events, it could cause the integrated
 signal to diverge from zero.
 In order to mitigate this effect, the integrated signal is exponentially
 decayed with a time constant of 2048 time bins.
 The actual integral decays faster than that due to the undershoot following
 a signal.
 Note that in any case, the integral depends upon the history of signals
 not only in the trace, but before the trace, so an exact offline reconstruction
 of the trigger is not possible.
 The integral remains valid for 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

250 time bins after the primary trigger.

Note that the MINx, OCC, and INT conditions are satisfied when the signal
 is strictly greater than (
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

) the register value, while MAXx condition is satisfied when the signal
 is less than or equal to (
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

) the register value.
 Thus writing 1023 to a MAXx register disables that constraint.

The veto is active for 
\begin_inset Formula $max(0,\,int(log_{2}(ph))+1-ofs)$
\end_inset

 bins following a aggregate step of size 
\begin_inset Formula $ph.$
\end_inset

 The veto can be disabled by setting OFS to 10 (decimal).
 Also note that a veto length of 1 has no effect since at least on negative
 bin to bin step is required to finish an aggregate step.
 The following table lists some example veto durations.

 If SHWR_BUF_TRIG_LED is set in the 
\color inherit
SHWR_BUF_TRIG_MASK register, then a trigger is generated on a LED flash,
 even if other trigger conditions are not met.
 Whether or not this bit is set in the SHWR_BUF_TRIG_MASK register, the
 presence of a LED flash is indicated in the SHWR_BUF_TRIG_ID register.

The trigger rates block counts reports the rates of several of the triggers
 accumulated over the last 26.8 seconds.
 The rate counters are double buffered, so there is always a static value
 representing the number of triggers during a 26.8 second interval that ended
 some time between 0 and 26.8 seconds ago.
 The trigger rate registers are organized as follows:

 is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, corresponding to which of the 4 simple triggers
 is desired.
 A signal amplitude must be strictly greater than its respective threshold
 for the trigger to fire.
 The multiplicity must be greater than or equal to the specified multiplicity.
 The window for the multiplicity logic coincidence can be set from 1 time
 bin (8.33 ns) up to 4 time bins.
 Loading 0 into the MUON_TRIG_COINC_OVLP bits sets the overlap to 1 bin,
 loading 1, sets it to 2 bins, etc.
 Either the WCD PMT or the SSD signal may be digitally delayed prior to
 forming a coincidence.
 Setting the MUON_TRIG_WCD_DELAY (or MUON_TRIG_SSD_DELAY) bits to 0 adds
 no delay, setting the bits to 1 adds 1 time bin delay, etc.
 Additionally, a requirement for more than one consecutive bin for each
 of the PMT, SSD signals to be above threshold can be added.
 Setting MUON_TRIG_CONSEC_BINS bits to 0 requires just 1 bin to be above
 threshold, setting it to 1, requires 2 bins to be above threshold, etc.

LED pulses may be generated under program control through the trigger module.
 (Ported original code developed by Roberto Assiro, Lecce.) Timing of the
 pulses is controlled by the trigger module.
 Amplitude of the pulses is controlled by the slow control micro-controller.
 There is one LED_CONTROL register at address LED_CONTROL_ADDR.
 The bit usage for this register is as follows:

 Each scaler instance accumulates counts of s single bin trigger instance.
 The count can be reset by writing (anything) to the scaler register.
 Unlike code versions prior to x010105y, these scalers are no longer tied
 to muon buffer intervals and they are not double buffered.
 Scaler incrementing is inhibited while scaler is being read.
 Each scaler block has the following format.

The *NANOSEC registers contain the 120 Mhz counter value in the low order
 27 bits (TTAG_NANOSEC_MASK).
 Bit 27 is always 0.
 In the TTAG_SHWR_NANOSEC and TTAG_MUON_NANOSEC, bits 31:28 contain the
 value of the event counter for the shower and muon buffer triggers respectively
 (TTAG_EVTCTR_SHIFT & TTAG_EVTCTR_MASK).
 The *SECONDS registers contain the seconds counter in the low order 28
 bits (TTAG_SECONDS_MASK).
 The high order 4 bits are zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TTAG_STATUS register contains bits useful for testing the time tagging
 module.
 Bits which get set in this register in response to stimuli can be reset
 via the TTAG_CONTROL register.
 The bit assignments in the TTAG_STATUS register are shown below.
